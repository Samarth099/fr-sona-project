# Fr-sona project

**Your real persona, portable.** Build a `personality.md` that any LLM agent can use so you sound like *you* — on every platform.

Fr-sona is a persona builder that lets you define:

- **Identity** — Name, role, bio, and what you never want to be represented as
- **Voice** — Tonal qualities, subject matter, and no-go zones
- **Platforms** — Calibrate formality, brevity, warmth, and boldness per platform (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Email, Discord, Instagram, Reddit)
- **Export** — Download or copy a markdown file to use as a system prompt prefix in Claude, GPT, Gemini, n8n, Make, Zapier, or any agent

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is in `dist/` (static site, ready for Vercel or any static host).
